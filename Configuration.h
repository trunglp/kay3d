/**The KAY3D Cheetah Firmware is brought to you by our software devs, the awesome 3D Printing community, and of course, we cannot forget the Marlin team
 * that has spent countless days, nights and years building Marlin up till where it is today.
 * 
 * This firmware is built on Marlin 2.0.3. 
 *  
 * This firmware has a simple set up Wizard. Go through all 14 sections, choose what you need to, ignore what you don't have, key in custom values if required
 * and hit compile.
 * It's really that simple. 
 * 
 * Please know that Cheetah 5.0 firmware is provided to you free of charge, in a "as-is" state. We cannot be held liable for the damanges that it
 * does to your 3D printer if any. Please proceed cautiously.
 * 
 * In Cheetah 5.0, 
 * You choose or define something by removing // in front of the code.
 * You can ignore a code by keeping // in front of the code
 * You can key in custom values by changing parameters called 'change_value'
 * 
 * * You can join in the discussion of the firmmware in our discord channel here:
 * 
 * https://discordapp.com/invite/Jw4UFKY
 * https://www.facebook.com/groups/712547579277208/
 * Official discussions on Marlin can and should also be discussed in Marlin's Github page

 * Bed Skew Compensation
 *
 * This feature corrects for misalignment in the XYZ axes.
 *
 * Take the following steps to get the bed skew in the XY plane:
 *  1. Print a test square (e.g., https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2563185)
 *  2. For XY_DIAG_AC measure the diagonal A to C
 *  3. For XY_DIAG_BD measure the diagonal B to D
 *  4. For XY_SIDE_AD measure the edge A to D
 *
 * Marlin automatically computes skew factors from these measurements.
 * Skew factors may also be computed and set manually:
 *
 *  - Compute AB     : SQRT(2*AC*AC+2*BD*BD-4*AD*AD)/2
 *  - XY_SKEW_FACTOR : TAN(PI/2-ACOS((AC*AC-AB*AB-AD*AD)/(2*AB*AD)))
 *
 * If desired, follow the same procedure for XZ and YZ.
 * Use these diagrams for reference:
 *
 *    Y                     Z                     Z

/**
 * RGB LED / LED Strip Control
 *
 * Enable support for an RGB LED connected to 5V digital pins, or
 * an RGB Strip connected to MOSFETs controlled by digital pins.
 *
 * Adds the M150 command to set the LED (or LED strip) color.
 * If pins are PWM capable (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 11) then a range of
 * luminance values can be set from 0 to 255.
 * For Neopixel LED an overall brightness parameter is also available.
 *
 * *** CAUTION ***
 *  LED Strips require a MOSFET Chip between PWM lines and LEDs,
 *  as the Arduino cannot handle the current the LEDs will require.
 *  Failure to follow this precaution can destroy your Arduino!
 *  NOTE: A separate 5V power supply is required! The Neopixel LED needs
 *  more current than the Arduino 5V linear regulator can produce.
 * *** CAUTION ***

 * LED Type. Enable only one of the following two options.
